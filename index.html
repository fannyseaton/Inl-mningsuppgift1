    <h3>
        <span>week we'll be discussing the concept of "Youtubability"-</span>
    <span>another important game guidline</span>
    </h3>

    <section class="flex-section">
       <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="flex-item-text">
            <h4 class="youtubability">
                Youtubability
            </h4>
            <p>
                A key driver of Youtubability is <strong>the clarity of your gameplay</strong> to a potential player.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the
                full potential of your game by working on
                getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your
                games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many elements can be used to make your
                game clearer:
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, ask yourself if a user’s interaction with the game is<strong> evident,</strong> for
                example, can she tell which character she
                <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it
                look <strong> fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the
                game after 1 second (great!) or after 10
                seconds (too long!).
            </p>   
            <p>
                Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate
                the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix
                Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in
                orange here) and instantly recognized as
                a threat.
            </p>

        If you want to run user tests with
        friends and family or even random
        people in the street, it is interesting to
        show them the 30 second video before
        making them try to prototype in order
        to <strong> understand their</strong> expectations from
        the video vs. the actual game they try. <br>
        <strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements
        that help <strong>understand the objective and
            controls</strong> of the game, like with the
        target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s
        Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw
        Car with the space dedicated to
        drawing.

        People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their
            phone’s Facebook feed,</strong> everything will seem smaller than when
        displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen.<strong> You should
            also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if
            someone watches it on a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3
        to 5 seconds, this is an <strong> accelerated elevator pitch!</strong> <br>
        Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on
        YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea
        for your game videos.
